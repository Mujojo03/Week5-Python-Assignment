# Week 5 Python Assignment

This project shows how to create Python classes, use inheritance, and practice polymorphism.

**Whatâ€™s inside:**
- `models.py`: Has all class definitions (like Smartphone and vehicles).

- `main.py`: Runs the program and shows how the classes work.

- Shows how one action (move) can behave differently in different classes.

Run the program with: `python3 main.py`
